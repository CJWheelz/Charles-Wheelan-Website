# charleswheelan.com

This website is for my dad, Charles Wheelan, who is an author and desperately needed a more modern website.

index.html - This is the home page for the website. It contains a brief bio and picture, a summary of his political party, the Centrist Party (now rebranded as Unite America), and a table with four of his books, images, summaries, and links to purchase.

books.html - This page contains summaries, images, and links for every book my dad has written.

bio.html - This page contains two more photos of my dad and a fairly in depth, but outdated biography.

author.html - This page just provides some more information on my dad, and his writing specifically.

speaker.html - This page is all about my dad and his speeches. It provides some information on what he talks about and his goals as a speaker.

professor.html - This page is about my dad's career as a professor, such as what classes he taught, and an article describing his take on oftentimes boring subjects (statistics and economics).

guy.html - This page (titled Guy Next Door) is just about my dad's personal life, such as his family, and where he lives. It has some (outdated) pictures of him and our entire family.

contact.html - This page is very simple. It provides a link to his email to contact him, as well as his office address. Finally, it has a link to his Facebook page, and a link to his Twitter.

Additional Info:
I tried to make this website as mobile compatible as possible, relying heavily upon Bootstrap's column layout and @ media queries.
