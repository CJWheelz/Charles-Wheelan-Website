                  What would happen if you quit your life for a year? In a pre-COVID-19 world, the Wheelan family decided to find out; leaving behind work, school, and even the family dogs to travel the world on a modest budget. Equal parts “how-to” and “how-not-to”—and with an eye toward a world emerging from a pandemic—<i>We Came, We Saw, We Left</i> is the insightful and often hilarious account of one family’s gap-year experiment.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Wheelan paints a picture of adventure and connectivity, juggling themes of local politics, global economics, and family dynamics while exploring answers to questions like: How do you sneak out of a Peruvian town that has been barricaded by the local army? And where can you get treatment for a flesh-eating bacteria your daughter picked up two continents ago? From Colombia to Cambodia, <i>We Came, We Saw, We Left</i> chronicles nine months across six continents with three teenagers. What could go wrong?

                Can statistics be interesting and intuitive? (I certainly suffered
                through some bad stats classes in college and graduate school.) The idea
                behind <i>Naked Statistics</i> was to update a W.W. Norton classic, <i>How to
                Lie with Statistics</i>, which has sold over a million copies.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are surrounded by data; statistics is the tool for making sense of
                that data, in fields ranging from retailing to law enforcement. <i>Naked
                Statistics</i> is packed with loads of examples (some of them quite funny).
                In a first for me as a writer, the book hit the <i>New York Times</i> nonfiction
                hardback bestseller list just a few weeks after publication in January of 2013.

                I pretty much wrote this book by accident, if that’s possible for a
                book.  I was teaching a course on economics at the Medill School of
                Journalism and I was not able to find a book that would be appropriate
                for the course.  I called a friend in the publishing industry and
                asked her for a recommendation.  I explained that I wanted a book
                that would convey the big ideas in economics without getting bogged
                down in the math.
              </p>

              <p>
                After a long pause, she said, “I don’t think there is one. But you’re
                going to write it. It’s going to be called <i>Economics for Poets</i>. And
                I’m going to read it.”

                Consider the $20 bill.
              </p>
              <p>
                It has no more value, as a simple slip of paper, than Monopoly money.
                Yet even children recognize that tearing one into small pieces is an
                act of inconceivable stupidity. What makes a $20 bill actually worth
                twenty dollars? In the third volume of his best-selling Naked series,
                Charles Wheelan uses this seemingly simple question to open the door
                to the surprisingly colorful world of money and banking.
              </p>
              <p>
                The search for an answer triggers countless other questions along the
                way: Why does paper money (“fiat currency” if you want to be fancy)
                even exist? And why do some nations, like Zimbabwe in the 1990s, print
                so much of it that it becomes more valuable as toilet paper than as
                currency? How do central banks use the power of money creation to stop
                financial crises? Why does most of Europe share a common currency, and
                why has that arrangement caused so much trouble? And will payment apps,
                bitcoin, or other new technologies render all of this moot?
              </p>
              <p>
                In <i>Naked Money</i>, Wheelan tackles all of the above and more, showing us
                how our banking and monetary systems should work in ideal situations
                and revealing the havoc and suffering caused in real situations by
                inflation, deflation, illiquidity, and other monetary effects.
                Throughout, Wheelan’s uniquely bright-eyed, whimsical style brings
                levity and clarity to a subject often devoid of both. With illuminating
                stories from Argentina, Zimbabwe, North Korea, America, China, and
                elsewhere around the globe, Wheelan demystifies the curious world behind
                the paper in our wallets and the digits in our bank accounts.

              <p>America is in trouble—at the mercy of a puzzling pathogen. That
                ordinarily wouldn’t lead to catastrophe, thanks to modern medicine,
                but there’s just one problem: the government supply of Dormigen,
                the silver bullet of pharmaceuticals, has been depleted just as
                demand begins to spike.
              </p>
              <p>
                Set in the near future, <i>The Rationing</i> centers around a White House
                struggling to quell the crisis—and control the narrative. Working
                together, just barely, are a savvy but preoccupied president; a
                Speaker more interested in jockeying for position—and a potential
                presidential bid—than attending to the minutiae of disease control;
                a patriotic majority leader unable to differentiate a virus from
                a bacterium; a strategist with brilliant analytical abilities but
                abominable people skills; and, improbably, our narrator, a low-level
                scientist with the National Institutes of Health who happens to
                be the world’s leading expert in lurking viruses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Little goes according to plan during the three weeks necessary to
                replenish the stocks of Dormigen. Some Americans will get the
                life-saving drug and others will not, and nations with their own
                supply soon offer aid—but for a price. China senses blood and a
                geopolitical victory, presenting a laundry list of demands that
                ranges from complete domination of the South China Sea to additional
                parking spaces at the UN, while India claims it can save the day

                In 2011, the Dartmouth class of 2011 invited me to be their
                faculty speaker for Class Day, which is a special Dartmouth
                ritual on the day before Commencement. (Conan O’Brien was the
                commencement speaker.) I’m a Dartmouth alum, so I had literally
                been sitting in the same place as those students, only 23 years earlier.
              </p>
              <p>
                I could not give a conventional speech. Instead, I gave a talk
                called “Five Things No Commencement Speaker Has Ever
                Said” (such as #1, Your Time in Fraternity Basements Was Not
                Wasted). There were actually six points in the speech; I had
                two number fours. The speech hit a nerve and began bouncing
                around the web. At that point, I worked with W.W. Norton to
                turn the speech into a book. I had the joy of working with the
                former <i>New Yorker</i> cartoonist Peter Steiner, whose great
                illustrations (including the cover at left) are a perfect
                complement to the text.

                From debt ceiling standoffs to single-digit Congress approval
                ratings, America’s political system has never been more polarized―or
                paralyzed―than it is today. As best-selling author and public
                policy expert Charles Wheelan writes, now is the time for a pragmatic
                Centrist party that will identify and embrace the best Democratic
                and Republican ideals, moving us forward on the most urgent issues
                for our nation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wheelan―who not only lectures on public policy but practices it
                as well (he ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2009)―brings even
                more than his usual wit and clarity of vision to <i>The Centrist
                Manifesto</i>. He outlines a realistic ground game that could net at
                least five Centrist senators from New England, the Midwest, and
                elsewhere. With the power to deny a red or blue Senate majority,
                committed Centrists could take the first step toward giving voice
                and power to America’s largest, and most rational, voting bloc:
                the center.

                This project was a complete blast. Terry Evans, an award-winning
                photographer was commissioned to take aerial photos of the Chicago
                region for an outdoor exhibit in Millennium Park. Terry asked me
                to write the captions and essays to accompany the photos.
              </p>
              <p>
                As Terry compiled photos, I went to work researching the shots
                and adding text. On one occasion, I had the chance to go up in a
                helicopter with her as she shot the Chicago skyline just after dawn.
                It was beautiful–but I will also admit that a tightly-circling
                helicopter giving off diesel exhaust can make one “helicopter sick”.
                (I just barely made it back to our base at Gary Airport.) Terry’s
                photos for the exhibit were compiled into this beautiful book.
