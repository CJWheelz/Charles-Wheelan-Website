                “Economics should not be accessible only to the experts. The
                ideas—especially now—are too important.” Enter Charles Wheelan:
                a speaker with a flair for turning the “dismal science” into
                talks that help us solve real world problems. In a new book,
                <i>Naked Statistics</i>, he makes sense of big data: data is simply raw
                fuel; statistics are what we create from it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many people—many otherwise intelligent people—struggle to
                understand even the basics of economics. They simply don’t “get”
                it. For them, for all of us, there’s Charles Wheelan, the breezy
                opposite of your typical droning economist. “Economics should not
                be accessible only to the experts. The ideas are too important
                and too interesting.” In all of his work, he shows us how to
                apply economics to solve real world problems. Wheelan has a flair
                for turning the so-called dismal science into affecting, comprehensible
                prose. Nowhere is this more evident than in his classic book, <i>Naked
                Economics</i>, an accessible and entertaining introduction to economics
                for lay readers.
              </p>
              <p>
                In <i>Naked Statistics: Stripping the Dread from the Data</i>,
                Wheelan strips away arcane and technical details to get at the
                underlying intuition that is so key to understanding the power of
                statistical concepts. <i>The Centrist Manifesto</i> is a call for a new
                political party, as Wheelan outlines and predicts at least five
                Centrist leaders emerging in New England, the Midwest, and elsewhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wheelan contributes regularly to NPR and other media outlets.
                The former Midwest correspondent for <i>The Economist</i>, and a former
                gubernatorial speechwriter, his book, <i>Naked Economics</i>, has been
                published in 14 languages. In his refreshingly honest book,
                <i>10 1/2 Things No Commencement Speaker Has Ever Said</i>, Wheelan
                offers 10 head-turning aphorisms—backed up by a Ph.D. in public
                policy and extensive social science research—that set the record
                straight on what graduates should expect in the real world, and
                how their partying and class-skipping has not, in fact, ruined
                their chances at success.

                <h1>Who & What?</h1>
                <p>
                  I have spoken to groups ranging from American Express senior
                  executives to high school students in Hawaii. I’ve done events
                  for the sales force of a major paper company, and I’ve
                  addressed the entire student body of a small liberal arts
                  college in rural Kentucky.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What do they all have in common? Each group is looking for
                  insights that can be gleaned from some of the most important
                  ideas in economics and statistics. But none wants to be drubbed
                  with a long, boring PowerPoint packed with irrelevant data. The
                  joy of these talks is that they can be surprisingly enjoyable,
                  even funny.
