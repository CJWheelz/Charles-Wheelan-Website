                I teach public policy at Dartmouth College.
                Prior to coming to Dartmouth full-time in the fall of 2012, I
                taught for eight years at the Harris School of Public Policy at
                the University of Chicago.
              </p>
              <p>
                My courses generally address “policy in the real world.”  How
                can we use economics and other academic tools to deal with real
                public challenges–immigration, climate change, mounting federal
                debt, and so on.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am the author of <i>Introduction to Public Policy</i>, a text that
                introduces a set of tools for basic policy analysis.

                newspaper in 2005 after I was voted Best Professor in a Non-Core
                Course by the Harris School student body.

          <h2>Charles Wheelan is the man with the anti-Midas touch.</h2>

          <p>By Steve Koppes (News Office)</p>

          <p>
            “If he touched gold he would turn it to life,” wrote Princeton
            University professor Burton Malkiel in the foreword to Wheelan’s
            book <i>Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science</i>, published in 2002.
          </p>
          <p>
            It appears that Wheelan applies the same touch to his University
            courses. Though he became a Lecturer in the Irving B. Harris Graduate
            School of Public Policy Studies only last year, students in his
            Analyzing and Communicating Policy course already have felt his
            energizing anti-Midas touch. For one class period each Fall and Spring
            Quarter, the students in this course find themselves seated in the
            studios of WBEZ-FM at Navy Pier, instead of the long, narrow confines
            of the Woodlawn Room in the 1155 Building on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            WBEZ is familiar territory for Wheelan. He is a long-time contributor
            both to WBEZ’s 848 public affairs program and to The Motley Fool, a
            nationally syndicated program on National Public Radio covering
            finance, economics and business.
          </p>
          <p>
            But students do the talking on these WBEZ field trips, not Wheelan,
            during an off-the-air version of 848 that culminates their group
            projects. “They have to come up with some policy recommendation,”
            Wheelan says. “It could be anything from changing Illinois recycling
            law to creating a global fund to providing an incentive for the
            creation of a malaria vaccine.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After the students have formulated their policy recommendation,
            “then they have to sell it. They’ve got to do a press release.
            They’ve got to do talking points. They’ve got to do an op-ed,”
            Wheelan says. And the student spokesmen for their respective groups
            also field questions from 848 host Steve Edwards, just as if they were
            really appearing on his show to propose their plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is fun, but it also shows the students there is more to a good
            policy recommendation than a good idea, Wheelan says. “It’s not
            really worth anything if they don’t go out and sell it and explain
            it cogently.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Wheelan, who also teaches Analysis of Regional Policy, says he has
            been impressed by the idealism and ability of Harris School students.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know that they fully appreciate how valued the skills they
            have are going to be,” he says. They will be entering a job market
            that is less well defined than that for graduates of business or
            law schools, so it requires more patience. “It takes longer for
            people to find the right places, probably because they’re going all
            over the place. To nonprofits, to international institutions, to
            private banks, what have you,” he says.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wheelan earned his own Ph.D. from the Harris School in 1998. He was
            the Midwest correspondent for <i>The Economist</i> from 1997 until 2002, a
            position he will again fill during the summer. Then he became
            director of policy and communications for Chicago Metropolis 2020,
            a business-sponsored not-for-profit group that conducts long-range
            planning for the region. Wheelan also is writing a textbook, <i>An
            Introduction to Public Policy</i>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Policy seems to be the theme that runs throughout Wheelan’s career.
            Even as a practicing journalist and former adjunct lecturer at
            Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, he taught policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I could probably be at a veterinary school and I’d somehow be
            teaching about policy,” he jokes.
          </p>
